# ML-projects
Worked on some basic datasets and problems for learning these ML algorithms.

## Logistic Regression

-  Titanic Dataset. 
-  Learned to deal with missing values by replacing them with mean value based on a categorical features from another column.
-  Used getdummies function for replacing categorical variables into numbers which can be used to train the model.
-  Predicted whether a person survived the Titanic or not based on the various attributes of the passengers.

## Linear Regression

## PCA

- Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets, increasing interpretability but at the same time minimizing information loss. It does so by creating new uncorrelated variables that successively maximize variance.
- Worked on breast cancer dataset which has 30 columns which are all important to determine whether the cancer is malignant or bening.
- Learned to use the Principal Component Analysis technique to reduce the dimensions of the datasets.

## KNN

## SVM
